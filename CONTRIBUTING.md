# Contributing to the YANG Confluent Schema Registry plugin

The Swisscom team, in collaboration with researchers and the IETF task group, has developed a plugin to support the YANG specs [RFC7950](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7950)
for network data modeling into Confluent Schema Registry.

> YANG is a data modeling language used to model configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls, and notifications for network management protocols.

_from RFC7950_

## First Things First

1. **When in doubt, open an issue** - For almost any type of contribution, the first step is opening an issue. 
Even if you think you already know what the solution is, writing down a description of the problem you're trying to 
solve will help everyone get context when they review your pull request. 

2. **Only submit your own work**  (or work you have sufficient rights to submit) -

3. When you're ready to start, we have see the next section for a contribution guide.

## How to contribute

Contributing to the YANG plugin for Confluent Schema Registry is a simple process.

1. As a Software Engineer interested in contributing to the YANG plugins, you will fork the repository.
2. Following that, you will clone the fork and work on your changes in your local copy of the code base.
3. Once the changes are complete,  you will [open a pull request](../../pulls) to start the change submission process.

After the pull request has landed a set of automated tests are going to be run, checking for potential security problems,
as well as a good coding style. 

4. A review, from the maintenance team, is going to follow with a review. 
Contributors are expected to work on the feedback before the pull request could be accepted.
5. Once the pull request gets accepted, the changes are going to be merge into the main project branch and be part of the next release.
